# Basic Calculator 

	Build a simple calculator, following the steps below. Focus on the functionality, not on styling.

## Constraints

- Do not use eval.

## Steps

- Create a simple button with the label '1'. Create a display above the button showing '0'.

- When button number#1 is clicked the display should change to 1.

- Create ten buttons for the numbers 0 to 9 and make them behave like button number#1. With every button click, the display should show the value of the clicked number.

- Change the behavior of the buttons to allow for a series of inputs to display multiple digits.

- Add a '+' button to allow for the addition of two numbers.

- Add an '=' button to update the display with the computed result. IE: The input series '1 + 5 =' should update the display to 6.

- Allow for multiple computations, one after another. IE: '1 + 2 + 4 =' should result in 7.

- Ensure that pressing numbers after pressing '=' resets the display to pressed number. IE: '1 + 1 = ' followed by a '3' should result in 3, not '23'.
